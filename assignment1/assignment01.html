    <br> The <b>Internet</b> is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite(TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. It is <span style="color : red">a network of networks</span> that consists
    of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources
    and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web(WWW), the infrastructure to support email, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing and telephony. <br><br>The origins of the Internet date back to
    research commissioned by the United States government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks.[2] This work, combined with work in the United Kingdom and France, led to the primary precursor network, the ARPANET,
    in the United States. A 1980 paper refers to "the ARPA internet". <span style="color:red;">The interconnection of regional academic networks in the 1980s marks the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet.</span> From the early 1990s, the
    network experienced sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to it. <br><br> For courses on this Internet Technologies visit <a href="https://www.iss.nus.edu.sg">Institute of Systems Science</a>    course page.
